# uni-coding-portfolio
A collection of coding projects focused on data analysis and machine learning. Includes various assignments, research projects, and experiments using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and more.

The following files are scripts used in my final year project, in which I used both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. 
- compositional data analysis.py
- impact data analysis.py
- tensile data analysis.py
- viscose data analysis.py

It is hard to fully contextualise the scripts without the data, which I cannot provide, but essentially I used ML algorithms to analyse  different properties of different materials.

The rest of the files in this repository are other university projects or projects completed outside of studies.
